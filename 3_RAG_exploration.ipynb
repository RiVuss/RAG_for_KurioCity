The rear facade has larger rectangular windows on the ground and first floor and smaller ones on the second floor, with two dormers in the roof. A rounded corner at the intersection of Vissteeg and Wijnstraat contains a niche with a statue of King William II, sculpted by J.Th. Stracké in 1849.

The building offers a nice variety in windows sizes,  arranged in different ways on each floor and facade. The east facade features large steel windows, and a gable end. The facade along Wijnstraat also has a gable end, next to a tower-like staircase with battlements. The rear facade has larger rectangular windows on the ground and first floor and smaller ones on the second floor, with two dormers in the roof. A rounded corner at the intersection of Vissteeg and Wijnstraat contains a niche with a statue of King William II, sculpted by J.Th. Stracké in 1849.  The corner of Blaak and Vissteeg is chamfered on the ground floor and finished with natural stone blocks.\\n\\nInside, the building holds further architectural interest. A noteworthy feature is the impressive natural stone hall with elaborate sculptures, topped by a glass roof – a remnant from the original 1904-1906 building, designed by Christiaan Posthumus Meyjes Jr.  There's also a massive vault in the basement.\\n\\nThis building’s value extends beyond its aesthetics.  Its traditional style, dating back to 1930-1934, holds significant architectural and cultural historical value, as well as urban planning value. Its place within the oeuvre of architect Kropholler further enhances its importance.\\n\"}\n",

It beautifully depicts a ship being unloaded by steam cranes, a clear reference to the building's original function. The symmetrical facade, with its classicist design, features a main entrance on the right. The building's foundation is of natural stone, while the rest of the exterior is brick with a crown molding and a hipped roof.\\n\\nStepping inside, you'll find a magnificent central hall dominated by a monumental staircase and a stunning stained-glass skylight designed by Jan Schouten. Spacious offices flank the front and rear of the building.  The boardroom and the director's office, located at the rear on the first floor, are particularly impressive.  Finished with oak and rosewood paneling, the boardroom once featured stained-glass windows depicting scenes from the company's history. In contrast, the offices for the employees were more modestly appointed. For its time, the building boasted modern conveniences such as a lift and central heating.  Interestingly, the second floor, accessible via a separate lift and staircase, served as residential space until 1976. The building has had a long history, including extensive use as a bank.  Recently, around 2020, Broek Bakema Architects undertook a meticulous renovation, restoring many original details and achieving an impressive energy label A.  The restoration beautifully preserves this significant piece of Rotterdam's heritage.\\n\"}\n",

Buskens, this former townhouse is a testament to craftsmanship.\\n\\nThe house is rectangular, featuring a basement, two floors, and an attic.  The facade, built with red brick and detailed with natural stone and yellow brick, is asymmetrically designed.  Notice the beautiful stained-glass windows and doors, some rectangular, some arched.  The steeply pitched roof is covered in slate. The gable ends are detailed with red brick and natural stone.\\n\\nTake a closer look at the ground floor.  You\\'ll see a wooden service entrance, a triple window with round toplights, a semi-circular window, and the impressive stone staircase leading to the main entrance. On the main floor, admire the portico with its yellow brick round arch supported by a natural stone column.  The front door itself is a work of art, with decorative wood and wrought iron detailing.  Above the entrance, a balcony, framed by natural stone, adds a touch of elegance.\\n\\nLook closely at the decorative details.  The tile tableau above the entrance proclaims \"sine labore nihil\" – \"nothing without labor.”  There\\'s another tableau above a window, displaying the year 1896. A stone medallion with a knight\\'s portrait is another notable detail.  The crowned cornice displays glazed tiles and sculpted figures: a lion and a young boy.  A small turret, featuring a three-light window and a tent roof with an iron crest, adds a distinct vertical element.\\n\\nEven the rear facade offers interesting features, such as projecting sections, balconies, and a loggia.  The interior retains original features including the patterned tile floors in the basement and the richly decorated hall and staircase.  Marble paneling, stucco work, and decorative doors contribute to the house\\'s grandeur.  The hall features a mirror vault supported by decorated consoles.\\n\\n\\nThis building is not just a beautiful structure; it\\'s a significant piece of Rotterdam\\'s history.

This building reflects that early vision.  Brick facades, windows with characteristic mullions, decorative elements, and the sloping roofs were all part of the plan to recreate the old city center, brick by brick.  While the overall approach to rebuilding later shifted towards more modern, functional designs, this building, along with a few others, remained true to this initial traditional style.  This was even though the architect who initially envisioned it was replaced in 1944.\\n\\nInterestingly, this project was spearheaded by Koos de Jong, a renowned builder and Olympic medalist, who commissioned the Rotterdam architectural firm Meischke and Schmidt. The building, with its shops on the ground floor,  business spaces at the rear, and six apartments across four floors, showcases a blend of practicality and traditional aesthetics. The use of gabled roofs, a hallmark of pre-war architecture, is a notable feature.  However, unlike typical pre-war buildings, this one incorporates a central stairwell, connecting the apartments into a single unit.\\n\\nAlthough admired for its unique design, the traditional style of this building wasn't universally embraced at the time.  A contemporary architectural journal expressed relief that the rest of the street wouldn't follow suit.  Today, however, it's recognised for its historical significance, and its status as a municipal monument reflects that appreciation. Its traditional design stands in contrast to the surrounding functionalist structures, making it a truly unique sight in this vibrant part of Rotterdam.\\n\"}\n",

This impressive building, however, was tragically destroyed during the bombing of Rotterdam in 1940, leaving only the bank's vault intact.\\n\\nThe bank needed a new headquarters, and the Coolsingel was chosen as the location.  Construction began in 1941, but was interrupted by the war. Despite the setbacks, the new building was eventually completed in 1949, a testament to the city's resilience and reconstruction efforts.  The building itself is a unique blend of traditional and modern architectural styles. Its red brick facade features vertical windows, echoing earlier designs.

Some felt that its imposing size and somewhat somber design clashed with the optimistic spirit of postwar reconstruction.  It was described as being too massive and dark, contrasting sharply with the vibrant atmosphere that was desired for the Coolsingel.   Regardless of these early criticisms, it remains a striking example of Rotterdam's architectural heritage, bearing witness to the city's journey through war and reconstruction, and having served as a major banking institution for many years.

Secondly, the ambitious Water Project, including the construction of the Westersingel canal, significantly altered the city's landscape. Then, the devastating bombing of 1940, which destroyed most of the historic city center, fundamentally changed its fate. The subsequent reconstruction, guided by the Master Plan for Reconstruction, shaped the city's urban development until the 1970s. Finally, the rise of high-rise buildings from the 1980s onward contributed to the modern skyline.\\n\\nThis remarkable transformation is evident throughout the city center.
